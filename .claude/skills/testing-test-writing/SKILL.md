name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write focused, behavior-driven tests that cover critical user flows without over-testing edge cases during development. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests, deciding what to test, naming test cases, mocking dependencies, or structuring test files. Apply when editing files in __tests__/, tests/, spec/, or any .test.ts, .spec.ts, .test.js, .spec.js files, and when using testing frameworks like Jest, Vitest, Mocha, or Playwright.

## When to use this skill

- When writing new unit tests, integration tests, or e2e tests
- When deciding what functionality to test and what to skip
- When focusing tests on core user flows and critical paths
- When deferring edge case testing to dedicated testing phases
- When naming test cases to clearly describe what's being tested
- When testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When structuring test files and organizing test suites
- When keeping tests fast to encourage frequent execution
- When editing files in __tests__/, tests/, spec/, or test/ directories
- When working with .test.ts, .spec.ts, .test.js, or .spec.js files
- When using Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Playwright, or other testing frameworks
- When writing assertions and expectations
- When deciding on test isolation and setup/teardown patterns
