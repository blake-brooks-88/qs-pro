name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, meaningful comments that explain complex logic rather than obvious operations. Use this skill when deciding whether to add comments, writing JSDoc or docstrings, documenting complex algorithms, or maintaining existing documentation. Apply when writing or reviewing any source code to ensure comments are evergreen, helpful, and not redundant with clear code.
