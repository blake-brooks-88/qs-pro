name: Frontend Components
description: Design and build reusable UI components following single responsibility, composability, and encapsulation principles. Use this skill when creating new React/Vue/Svelte components, refactoring existing components, defining component props and interfaces, managing component state, or structuring component hierarchies. Apply when editing files in components/, ui/, or any directory containing reusable frontend UI elements with .jsx, .tsx, .vue, or .svelte extensions.

- When deciding what state should be local vs lifted to parent components
- When composing complex UIs from smaller, simpler components
- When implementing component APIs with sensible defaults
- When naming components and their props descriptively
- When splitting large components into smaller, focused pieces
- When documenting component usage and examples
- When editing files in components/, ui/, shared/, or common/ directories
- When working with .jsx, .tsx, .vue, or .svelte component files
- When applying the single responsibility principle to UI components
- When deciding between controlled and uncontrolled components
- When implementing render props, compound components, or higher-order components
