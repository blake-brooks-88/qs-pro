name: Backend Models
description: Define database models and entities with proper naming, relationships, constraints, and data types. Use this skill when creating new database models or entities, defining table schemas, setting up model relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, belongsTo, hasMany), adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys), choosing appropriate data types, or configuring ORM model definitions. Apply when editing files like models/, entities/, schema.prisma, or any file defining database table structures.

- When choosing appropriate data types for columns
- When adding timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) to models
- When configuring cascade behaviors for relationships
- When indexing foreign key columns or frequently queried fields
