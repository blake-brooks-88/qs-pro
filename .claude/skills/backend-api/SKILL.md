name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles, HTTP conventions, and proper resource naming. Use this skill when creating new API routes, modifying existing endpoints, working with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), setting up API versioning, implementing pagination or filtering, defining URL structures, returning HTTP status codes, or working with rate limiting. Apply when editing files like routes.ts, controllers, api/ directories, endpoint handlers, or any server-side code that handles HTTP requests and responses.

- When implementing pagination, filtering, sorting, or search query parameters
- When setting up or modifying API versioning strategies
- When defining HTTP status codes for API responses
- When working with rate limiting headers and configurations
- When editing files in routes/, controllers/, api/, or endpoints/ directories
- When working with files like routes.ts, router.ts, controller.ts, or handler.ts
- When designing nested resource URLs or parent-child relationships in APIs
- When standardizing HTTP method usage across the application
