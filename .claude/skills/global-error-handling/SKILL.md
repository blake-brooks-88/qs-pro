name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, and graceful degradation patterns. Use this skill when adding try-catch blocks, creating custom error classes, handling API errors, implementing retry logic, or designing error boundaries. Apply when writing error handling code in any layer of the application, from API controllers to frontend components, ensuring errors are handled consistently and informatively.

## When to use this skill

- When adding try-catch blocks or error handling logic
- When creating custom error classes or exception types
- When handling API errors and HTTP error responses
- When writing user-friendly error messages
- When implementing fail-fast validation with clear error messages
- When designing centralized error handling at API boundaries
- When implementing graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- When adding retry logic with exponential backoff
- When cleaning up resources in finally blocks
- When handling errors in async/await or Promise chains
- When implementing error boundaries in React applications
- When logging errors for debugging and monitoring
- When deciding what error details to expose to users vs. hide
- When editing controller files, service files, or API handlers
