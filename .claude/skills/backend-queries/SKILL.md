name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, performant database queries using parameterized queries, proper joins, and query optimization techniques. Use this skill when writing SQL queries, using ORM query builders, implementing database lookups, optimizing slow queries, preventing SQL injection, using transactions, or implementing caching for database operations. Apply when editing repository files, service files with database calls, files using Knex/Prisma/TypeORM query syntax, or any code that reads from or writes to a database.

## When to use this skill

- When writing raw SQL queries or ORM query builder code
- When implementing database lookups, inserts, updates, or deletes
- When optimizing slow or expensive database queries
- When preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities
- When avoiding N+1 query problems with eager loading or joins
- When selecting specific columns instead of SELECT *
- When adding indexes to improve query performance
- When wrapping related operations in database transactions
- When implementing query timeouts to prevent runaway queries
- When caching expensive or frequently-run query results
- When editing repository files, DAO files, or service files with database calls
- When working with Knex, Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize, or raw SQL
- When writing WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY clauses
- When implementing pagination at the database level
