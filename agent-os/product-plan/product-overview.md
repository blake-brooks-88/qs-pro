# Query++ — Product Overview

## Summary

Query++ is an ISV-grade SQL IDE for Salesforce Marketing Cloud Engagement (MCE) that reduces query development time and prevents runtime failures through a focused “Zen Mode” workspace with intelligent guardrails.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem: The "Scratchpad" Limit & Silent Failures
A Zen Mode IDE with real-time guardrails that warn users about invalid SQL as they type and provides persistent storage for all queries.

### Problem: Security and PII Exposure
A Zero-Data Proxy Architecture that processes results in memory without unnecessary persistence, ensuring PII is handled securely.

### Problem: Production Deployment Friction
Direct-to-Automation deployment that allows users to save queries directly as permanent MCE Query Activities from the IDE.
