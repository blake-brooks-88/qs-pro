what does the shell query engine involve again? we just finished setting up the oauth flow. we have the ability to retrieve all DE folders in a BU as well as the ability to retireve all DE names and DE fields based on a customer key.

My thinking was next we could focus on updating the sidebar to load in the DE folder structure to display all of the DEs. the idea would be that the root level folders would be loaded first with a button to expand to see the child folders as well as any DEs inside of that folder

when expanded, the subfolders will also be collapsed by default. the DE will be collapsed by default and just show the name, but expanding the name of the DE will show all of the fields for that DE.

I was thinking we could focus on this first.
