# Verification Report: MCE Bridge & Metadata Discovery

**Spec:** `2026-01-04-mce-bridge-metadata-discovery`
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The implementation of the MCE Bridge and Metadata Discovery services has been successfully completed and verified. The backend infrastructure correctly handles OAuth token refresh, SOAP/REST request wrapping, and error normalization. The Metadata service effectively retrieves and caches folders, data extensions (local & shared), and fields. A simple frontend verification page confirms the end-to-end data flow.
