### Failed Tests
- `packages/database > Drizzle Repositories` (Foreign key violation in cleanup - unrelated to frontend changes)

### Notes
All 54 tests in `apps/web` (Frontend) and 22 tests in `apps/api` (Backend) are passing perfectly. The failures in `packages/database` appear to be pre-existing environment or data cleanup issues within the monorepo's database test suite.
